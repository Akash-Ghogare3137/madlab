1. Write a program to cluster a set of points using K-means. Consider, K=4, clusters. 
Consider Euclidean distance as the distance measure. Randomly initialize a cluster 
mean as one of the data points. Iterate for 10 iterations. After iterations are over, print 
the final cluster means for each of the clusters. 
Data set iris data set  

2. The table below gives the amount of Crabby Cakes made by Bakers for each year he’s 
worked.   
Graph the data on a scatter plot, find the line of best fit, and write the equation for the line 
you draw.  
Years worked 1       2        3         4        5        6
Cakes  made 6,500   7,805   10,835    11,230     15,870    16,387 

Correlation Coefficient (r): _________ 
Type of Correlation: ______________________ 
Using the linear regression equation predict how many Crabby cakes he will make 
after working 10 years.
